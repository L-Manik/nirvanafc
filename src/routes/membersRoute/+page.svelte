					1991, signing with Geffen Records. Cobain also began using heroin around this time. After
					releasing the highly successful album Nevermind, Nirvana's highly acclaimed album In Utero
					was released in 1993 and catapulted to the top of the music charts. On April 5, 1994, in
					the guest house behind his Seattle home, Cobain committed suicide.
